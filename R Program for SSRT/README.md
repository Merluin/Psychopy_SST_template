 # IMPLICIT Data Analysis

Welcome to the IMPLICIT data analysis repository, a project conducted at the University of Bologna. This research is dedicated to exploring the intricate dynamics of the stop signal task (SST) and the impact of fear priming on cognitive processes.

**Description**: This experiment investigates cognitive control and response inhibition under the influence of subliminal fear and neutral priming. The data analysis is executed using R programming language, and the repository includes all the necessary scripts and documentation. Dr. Thomas Quettier, PhD, spearheads the analysis efforts. For inquiries or detailed information, Dr. Quettier can be contacted at thomas.quettier2@unibo.it.

### Experiment Details

- **Data Preprocessing**: The initial data processing was conducted using Matlab. The data files, available in the repository, commence with the computation of the Stop-Signal Reaction Time (SSRT), accounting for both fear and neutral priming conditions for each subject.

- **SICI Measurements**: Short-Interval Cortical Inhibition (SICI) data is available for 16 out of the total 46 participants (16 in the lab group and 30 in the home group).

## Accessing Analysis Codes

To access and utilize the analysis codes:

1. **Download the Complete Repository**: Begin by downloading the entire repository to your local machine.

2. **Open the R Project**: Navigate to the `implicit.Rproj` file and open it. This file is the R project file that will set up your working environment.

3. **Install Required Libraries**: Before proceeding, ensure that all the necessary R libraries are installed for a smooth analysis process.

4. **Repository Structure**: 
   - `/data`: This directory contains the data files used in the analysis.
   - `/R`: Here, you'll find utility files and functions critical for the analysis.
   - `/scripts`: This folder houses all the scripts used for data analysis.

5. **Readme File**: For a detailed overview of the repository and guidance on how to navigate and use the files, refer to the `Readme.md` file included in the root directory.
